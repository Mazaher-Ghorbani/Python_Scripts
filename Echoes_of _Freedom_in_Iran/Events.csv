1978,1,The Islamic Revolution,"A broad coalition of Islamists, Marxists, and liberals rose up against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The 2,500-year-old monarchy was abolished, replaced by a theocratic ""Islamic Republic"" under Supreme Leader Khomeini. This shifted Iran from a key U.S. ally to a defiant anti-Western power."
1979,2,Women's Mandatory Hijab Protests,"Reason: Six days of protests began on International Women's Day after Ayatollah Khomeini decreed women must wear the hijab. Casualties: No confirmed deaths from gunfire, but many were beaten by pro-regime mobs. Political Effect: It was the first major pushback against the new theocracy. While it delayed full enforcement, it eventually led to the 1983 law making the hijab mandatory for all women."
1983,3,Ethnic Rights Protests,"Reason: Post-revolution, Kurds, Arabs, and Turkmens sought autonomy and cultural rights. Casualties: Estimated 10,000+ killed in armed conflicts and executions. Political Effect: The regime used these ""rebellions"" to justify the creation of the Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and to consolidate power by branding ethnic activists as ""separatists"" or ""foreign agents."""
1988,4,Mass Political Executions,"Reason: A secret ""Death Committee"" purged prisons of political dissidents (mostly MEK and leftists) following a fatwa. Casualties: Estimated 2,800 to 5,000 (some sources say more) executed in weeks. Political Effect: This eliminated an entire generation of opposition. It remains the most significant ""crime against humanity"" in the regime's history and is a major point of international legal scrutiny today."
1999,5,Student Protests,"Reason: Sparked by the closure of the reformist newspaper Salam and a brutal raid on student dormitories. Casualties: At least 1–5 students killed; thousands arrested. Political Effect: It shattered the illusion that the ""Reformist"" wing of the government could change the system from within, leading students to move toward calling for a secular democracy."
2003,6,Student Anti-Repression Protests,"Reason: Protests against the death sentence of professor Hashem Aghajari and the lack of freedom of expression. Casualties: 0 confirmed deaths, but hundreds were tortured and ""disappeared"" in secret prisons. Political Effect: Led to a massive crackdown on student unions and a wave of ""forced confessions"" on national TV to discredit the movement."
2005,7,Ahvaz Discrimination Protests,"Reason: Leaked documents suggested government plans to displace Arab Iranians and ""Persianize"" the Khuzestan region. Casualties: Dozens killed; hundreds arrested. Political Effect: Increased the militarization of Khuzestan. It highlighted the intersection of ethnic marginalization and economic grievances in oil-rich regions."
2009,8,Green Movement Protests,"Reason: Allegations of massive fraud in the presidential election (""Where is my vote?""). Casualties: 70 to 150+ killed (including Neda Agha-Soltan). Political Effect: The largest protests since 1979. It caused a permanent rift within the Iranian elite and led to the long-term house arrest of opposition leaders Mousavi and Karroubi."
2011,9,Economic and Labor Protests,"Reason: High inflation and unemployment, partially influenced by the ""Arab Spring"" and international sanctions. Casualties: Limited fatalities, but high numbers of labor leaders were imprisoned. Political Effect: Shifted the focus of resistance from the middle-class ""Green Movement"" to the working-class and labor unions."
2017,10,Nationwide Anti-Regime Protests,"Reason: Rapidly rising food prices and a stagnant economy. Casualties: Approximately 25 killed. Political Effect: Significant because protests spread to small, conservative towns previously thought to be regime strongholds. The slogans shifted from ""reform"" to ""Death to the Dictator."""
2019,11,"""Bloody November"" Fuel Protests","Reason: A sudden 200% hike in fuel prices. Casualties: Estimated 300 to 1,500 killed in just five days during a total internet blackout. Political Effect: This was a turning point of extreme state violence. It completely broke the social contract between the regime and the working class."
2020,12,Flight PS752 Shootdown Protests,"Reason: The IRGC shot down a civilian plane and lied about it for three days. Casualties: 176 died on the plane; protesters were later tear-gassed and arrested. Political Effect: Sparked a crisis of legitimacy. Protesters chanted ""The IRGC is our ISIS,"" showing a direct loss of respect for the military elite."
2021,13,Khuzestan Water Shortage Protests,"Reason: Severe water mismanagement and the drying of the Zayandeh-Rud river. Casualties: At least 8–11 killed. Political Effect: Highlighted the ""Environmental Crisis"" as a new driver for revolution, proving that the regime can no longer provide basic necessities like water."
2022,14,"""Woman, Life, Freedom"" Protests","Reason: The death of Mahsa Amini in morality police custody for ""improper hijab."" Casualties: Over 550 killed (including 68 minors) and 20,000+ arrested. Political Effect: The first feminist-led revolution in history. It led to a permanent change in social norms, as many women now refuse to wear the hijab in public despite the risks."
2026,15,Nationwide Anti-Regime Protests,"Reason: The total collapse of the Rial and extreme hyperinflation. Casualties: Emerging reports suggest upward of 12,000 killed/disappeared in a massive crackdown. Political Effect: Shows the transition from ""protests"" to ""organized resistance."" The regime is increasingly relying on raw force as it loses all economic and social control."
